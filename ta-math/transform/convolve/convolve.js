// function to read the convolve window?
//  or in a read directory, a 'window'.

// Or calculate it into a parallel data structure?

// Parallel distributed kernels would be useful.


// Direct algorithms as ta math, and test them.


// Single channel convolve here.

// Operate single channel on a multi-channel ta?

// Therefore do multi-channel convolve...?

// A moving pixel window over the pixels...

// Possibly a loop to do that...

// each pixel, then each pixel in the window.
//  window could be best defined by 4 edge offsets.
